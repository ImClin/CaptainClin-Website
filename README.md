# CaptainClin-Website
The Website is a personal project created with the purpose of expanding my knowledge in various programming languages and building a personal platform for individuals to learn more about me. The website is primarily developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, however, I am open to incorporating new technologies as I continue to grow my skillset.
